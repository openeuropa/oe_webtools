composer require openeuropa/oe_webtools
```

### Enable the module

In order to enable the module in your project run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drush en oe_webtools
```

## Development setup

You can build the test site by running the following steps.

* Install all the composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

* Customize build settings by copying `runner.yml.dist` to `runner.yml` and
changing relevant values, like your database credentials.

* Generate configuration files:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-setup
```

* Install the site:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Your test site will be available at `./build`.

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running, 
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new 
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the behat tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```
