# OpenEuropa Webtools eTrans

This component provides the integration with the Webtools eTranslation service.

## What it does
The `oe_webtools_etrans` module offers 2 blocks:
* OpenEuropa Webtools eTrans: This block displays a "Translate this page" link, allowing your visitors to select a language from the official EU language list in a modal. Upon selection, the page will be translated using the eTrans service.
* OpenEuropa Unified eTrans: This block displays a banner on non-translated pages, offering your users the opportunity to translate the page into the language of their choice, selected from the interface.

## How to use

### OpenEuropa Webtools eTrans

To add the "Translate this page" link to your website, simply place the OpenEuropa Webtools eTrans block in the desired location. This block is primarily managed by the webtools API. The selection of available languages for translation is provided by the webtools service.

### OpenEuropa Unified eTrans

To use the OpenEuropa Unified eTrans block, ensure the following steps are completed:

- Enable at least one language other than English in the Drupal language settings (/admin/config/regional/language).
- Place the language switcher block on your website, allowing users to select their preferred language.
- Add the OpenEuropa Unified eTrans block to the desired location on your website.

Once a user visits a page that does not have a translation available and is browsing the website in a language other than the default one, they will be presented with a banner offering them the opportunity to translate the page using the eTrans service.
